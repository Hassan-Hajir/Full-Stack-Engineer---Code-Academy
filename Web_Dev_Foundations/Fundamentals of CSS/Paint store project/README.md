<h1>Practise project on CSS colors</h1>
<h2>Paint Store</h2>
In this project, i followed step-by-step instructions to improve a vibrant, color-rich web page for a home paint business. It displays information about using color in a home and color swatches with varying lightness, saturation, and hue.

The page is almost ready to be published.i made the following color-related changes

<ul>
	<li>Exchanged some named colors with hexadecimal color values.</li>
	<li>Added some semi-transparent overlays to the banner and footer using RGBA.</li>
	<li>Filled in the first color column of the swatch samples using HSL colors.</li>
</ul>
